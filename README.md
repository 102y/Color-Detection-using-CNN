# Color-Detection-using-CNN
This project focuses on building a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can predict the dominant color of an image based on its RGB values. The model is trained using a dataset of known color names and their respective RGB values. The goal is to enable the model to classify an imageâ€™s dominant color by analyzing its pixel data.
